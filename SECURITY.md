# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public GitHub issue.

Instead, use GitHub’s **Private vulnerability reporting / Security Advisories** for this repository so maintainers can coordinate a fix before disclosure.

If private reporting is not available for some reason, please open a minimal public issue **without exploit details** and clearly mark it as security-related.

## Supported versions

TankLog is a frontend-only app that is currently developed on the `master` branch. Security fixes are applied to the latest codebase.
