# TankLog — Source of truth (always applied)

Always treat these as the canonical requirements/spec:

@project.md
@roadmap.md

## Rules
- **Follow constraints first**: frontend-only, SSG, free stack, user-controlled data storage.
- **Roadmap-driven work**: keep changes small and aligned to the current sprint scope; update `roadmap.md` if scope changes.
- **Call out conflicts early**: if a request violates constraints, explain why and propose the closest compliant alternative.
